1 - The waterfall method differes from agile because agile allows you to be flexible
to work on different things at the same time, many scopes of work.  Waterfall you are rigid
and the activity you are on should be completed before moving onto the next.

2 - Responding to change could get a team into trouble, as this could create scope screep if
not monitored properly.

3 - Agile is about being flexible and reactive to development, not having to stick 100% to a plan.

4 - I think requirements change for a few reasons, fundnig could impact on if things are added or
removed. Requirements may have been taken badly, so they then need changing. Someone else may take over
the project and decide they want a slightly different direction, thus impacting the requirements.

5 - Understanding what is required from a test means that the solution will be better suited to what
the requirements will be.  It stops random problem happening that may not have been thought of.
