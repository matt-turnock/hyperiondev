- To begin with, the background colour is, tragic.  I find it really hard to take in the information due to colour scheme
and font colour/sizing.  Nothing about the website UI look professional at all.  The icons for the

Good elements are that is has a clearly visible search function for their products, and displays some of their products
on the main page, although this is still quite hard to read.

In summary the UI needs a lot of work to make it more aestheically pleasing, as currently its an eye sore to look at.


- The second website, is much nicer to look at, i think it is laid out much better, has some clearly marked help features
and uses a good colour palette that is easy on the eye.  They provide a really well laid out process for their service on
the front page, which is probably one of their most asked questions.

In summary this website UI is MUCH better than the previous.
